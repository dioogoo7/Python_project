Instacart Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. The project’s objective is to increase sales by uncovering more information about the sales patterns and the clients' purchasing behaviours. My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of the data to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.

### Key Questions
* What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
* What are the times of the day when people spend the most money?
* Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
* What’s the distribution among users in regard to their brand loyalty?
* Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
* Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
* Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
* What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? 
* What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?

The second row of boxes represents the data sets after manipulation, e.g. removal of missing values and duplicates. 
The third row represents the merges that were performed between the datasets.
